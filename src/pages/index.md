  title: What is the Turing Scholars Honors Program?
  description: |+
    The Turing Scholars Program is an honors program for outstanding Computer Science undergraduates at UT Austin. Housed in the nation's 10th ranked CS department, the program's mission is to provide a CS education that is second to none.
    
    The program combines the advantages of a small college—small class sizes, strong community, close interaction with faculty, and honors housing—with the advantages of a large research university, including a large variety of undergraduate and graduate courses, and ample opportunities for interdisciplinary studies.

  Kaldi is the ultimate spot for coffee lovers who want to learn about their
  java’s origin and support the farmers that grew it. We take coffee production,
  roasting and brewing seriously and we’re glad to pass that knowledge to
  anyone.

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
